# Customer-Churn-Analysis

While exploring customer churn challenges for a telecom company, I discovered that a significant portion of users were leaving after short tenures. Using Power BI, I analyzed over 7,000 customer records and built an interactive dashboard to uncover key churn drivers. The analysis revealed that customers on month-to-month contracts, especially those using fiber optic internet and electronic check payments, were more likely to churn. These insights helped propose targeted retention strategies, making the analysis both actionable and business-focused.
